										<h3>Twice story</h3>
										<p>
											Twice (Hangul: 트 와이스; Japanese: ト ゥ ワ イ ス), is a female idol group from South Korea formed by JYP Entertainment. This group consists of nine members: Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu. Twice was formed through a television program called Sixteen, and made their debut on October 20, 2015 with a mini album titled The Story Begins.
											Twice shot to fame in 2016 with the song "Cheer Up" which peaked at No.1 on the Gaon Digital Chart, became the best selling single of the year, and won "Song of the Year" at the Melon Music Awards and the Mnet Asian Music Awards. Their next song, "TT", from their third mini album, Twicecoaster: Lane 1, has topped the Gaon music charts for four consecutive weeks. The mini album is the best-selling K-pop female idol group album for 2016. Within 19 months of debut, Twice has sold over 1.2 million copies of their four mini albums and one special album. In 2019, they became the best-selling Korean female idol group in history. As of July 2020, this group has sold more than 9 million albums in South Korea and Japan. In 2020, Twice signed a contract with Republic Records for promotion purposes in the United States as part of their partnership with JYP Entertainment.
											Twice made their Japanese debut on June 28, 2017 under the label Warner Music Japan, with the release of their compilation album, #Twice. The compilation album took second place on the Oricon Albums Chart with the best first week sales among all K-pop artists promoting in Japan in the past two years. This achievement was followed by the release of Twice's first original Japanese maxi single, entitled "One More Time" in October. Twice became the first Korean female idol group to be certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for the album and CD singles category in the same year. Twice took third in the Best Artist category in the Billboard Japan version of the year-end ranking for 2017. They have been dubbed as the next "Nation's Girl Group", and key moves in their choreography especially the songs "Cheer Up", "TT" and "Signal" have become viral memes whose moves have been copied by many celebrities.
